CS50 final project

This program will either be a game or an application of some sort. Preferably going to run on IOS. Main languages are probably going to be Swift and Python.

This program is an IOS application designed to identify and quote Pokemon cards. In addition it allows users to look up any Pokemon and be provided with all the neccesary information. It allows users to register in order to keep track of the user's collection of Pokemon cards and keeps a log of the user's search history.
